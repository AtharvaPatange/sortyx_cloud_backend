# Render Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® Common Render Deployment Failures & Solutions

### ‚ùå Problem -1: PyTorch 2.6+ YOLO Model Loading Error (CRITICAL - FIXED!)
**Error Message:**
```
ERROR:app:‚ùå Error loading pose model: Weights only load failed
WeightsUnpickler error: Unsupported global: GLOBAL ultralytics.nn.tasks.PoseModel
cannot import name 'C2fAttn' from 'ultralytics.nn.modules'
```

**Root Cause:** 
- PyTorch 2.6+ changed `torch.load()` default to `weights_only=True` for security
- YOLO models use pickle serialization with Python classes that are blocked
- Previous fix tried importing non-existent modules (`C2fAttn` doesn't exist in ultralytics 8.0.231)

**Solution:** ‚úÖ **FIXED with monkey-patch approach!**

Instead of trying to register safe globals (which failed), we now **monkey-patch `torch.load()`** to use `weights_only=False` for YOLO models:

```python
# Store original torch.load function
_original_torch_load = torch.load

def _patched_torch_load(f, map_location=None, pickle_module=None, *, weights_only=None, **kwargs):
    """Force weights_only=False for YOLO models (safe for trusted sources)"""
    if weights_only is None:
        weights_only = False
    return _original_torch_load(f, map_location=map_location, 
                                pickle_module=pickle_module, 
                                weights_only=weights_only, **kwargs)

# Apply the monkey patch BEFORE importing YOLO
torch.load = _patched_torch_load
```

**Why this is SAFE:**
1. ‚úÖ We only load official ultralytics YOLO models from trusted sources
2. ‚úÖ Models are downloaded from official GitHub releases
3. ‚úÖ This is PyTorch's recommended approach for legacy model formats
4. ‚úÖ Applied BEFORE importing YOLO, so all model loading uses the patched version

### ‚ùå Problem 0: Python 3.13 Compatibility Error (NEW!)
**Error Message:**
```
AttributeError: module 'pkgutil' has no attribute 'ImpImporter'
ERROR: Failed to build 'numpy' when getting requirements to build wheel
```

**Cause:** 
- Render defaulted to Python 3.13 which removed `pkgutil.ImpImporter`
- Older versions of numpy/setuptools are incompatible with Python 3.13

**Solution:** ‚úÖ Fixed!
1. Created `runtime.txt` with `python-3.11.0`
2. Updated `requirements.txt` with pinned numpy==1.24.3
3. Added setuptools and wheel to requirements
4. Updated `render.yaml` to specify `runtime: python-3.11.0`

**Why Python 3.11?**
- ‚úÖ Stable and well-tested
- ‚úÖ Compatible with all ML libraries (ultralytics, opencv, numpy)
- ‚úÖ Recommended for production ML applications
- ‚ùå Python 3.13 is too new - many packages haven't updated yet

---

### ‚ùå Problem 1: OpenCV ImportError
**Error Message:**
```
ImportError: libGL.so.1: cannot open shared object file
```

**Cause:** Missing system dependencies for OpenCV

**Solution:** ‚úÖ Already fixed with `Aptfile` and `packages.txt`

---

### ‚ùå Problem 2: Port Binding Error
**Error Message:**
```
Error: Address already in use
or
uvicorn.config.ServerNotRunning
```

**Cause:** App hardcoded to port 8000 instead of using Render's `$PORT` variable

**Solution:** ‚úÖ Already fixed in `app.py` - now uses `os.getenv("PORT", 8000)`

---

### ‚ùå Problem 3: Build Timeout
**Error Message:**
```
Build exceeded maximum time limit
```

**Cause:** 
- YOLO models downloading during build (can take 5-10 minutes)
- Render free tier has build timeout limits

**Solution:**
1. Models will download on first request (not during build)
2. First deployment takes 3-5 minutes - be patient
3. Upgrade to Starter plan if timeouts persist

---

### ‚ùå Problem 4: Memory Limit Exceeded
**Error Message:**
```
Out of memory or Process killed
```

**Cause:** 
- YOLO models use ~400MB RAM
- Free tier has 512MB limit

**Solution:**
1. Current setup is optimized for 512MB
2. If still failing, upgrade to Starter plan (512MB+ guaranteed)
3. Check logs for memory usage: `less /var/log/syslog`

---

### ‚ùå Problem 5: Static Files Not Found
**Error Message:**
```
RuntimeError: Directory 'static' does not exist
```

**Cause:** Missing `static/` or `templates/` directories

**Solution:** ‚úÖ Already fixed - directories created with `.gitkeep` files

---

### ‚ùå Problem 6: GEMINI_API_KEY Not Set
**Error Message:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è GEMINI_API_KEY not found
```

**Cause:** Environment variable not configured in Render dashboard

**Solution:**
1. Go to Render Dashboard ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí Environment
2. Add: `GEMINI_API_KEY` = `your_actual_api_key`
3. **Important:** Remove the exposed API key from your `.env` file!

---

### ‚ùå Problem 7: Health Check Failing
**Error Message:**
```
Health check failed
```

**Cause:** 
- App not responding on `/health` endpoint
- Models still loading

**Solution:**
1. Health check path is set to `/health` ‚úÖ
2. First startup takes 2-3 minutes for model download
3. Check logs to see if models loaded successfully

---

## üîß Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check Render Logs
```bash
# In Render Dashboard ‚Üí Logs tab
# Look for these indicators:

‚úÖ Good Signs:
- "‚úÖ YOLOv8 Pose model loaded"
- "‚úÖ YOLO detection model loaded"  
- "‚úÖ Gemini API configured"
- "Application startup complete"

‚ùå Bad Signs:
- "ImportError: libGL.so.1"
- "Out of memory"
- "Port already in use"
- "‚ö†Ô∏è GEMINI_API_KEY not found"
```

### Step 2: Test Health Endpoint
```bash
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "models_loaded": {
    "yolo_detection": true,
    "yolo_pose": true,
    "gemini_configured": true
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Check Build Command
In Render Dashboard:
- **Build Command:** `pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command:** `uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT --workers 1`

### Step 4: Verify Environment Variables
Required variables:
- ‚úÖ `GEMINI_API_KEY` (set in dashboard)
- ‚úÖ `PORT` (automatically set by Render)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `PYTHON_VERSION=3.11.0` (optional)

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before pushing to Render:

- [x] `Procfile` created with start command
- [x] `render.yaml` configured
- [x] `Aptfile` has system dependencies
- [x] `packages.txt` has OpenCV libraries
- [x] `app.py` uses `$PORT` variable
- [x] `static/` and `templates/` directories exist
- [x] `.gitignore` excludes `.env` file
- [ ] GEMINI_API_KEY set in Render dashboard (‚ö†Ô∏è DO THIS!)
- [ ] Removed exposed API key from `.env`

---

## üöÄ Post-Fix Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and push changes:**
```bash
cd /Users/ranjith/development/cloud-sbin-app
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Render deployment issues"
git push origin main
```

2. **Trigger manual deploy in Render:**
   - Go to Render Dashboard
   - Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"

3. **Monitor deployment:**
   - Watch logs in real-time
   - Wait 3-5 minutes for first deployment
   - Check for success messages

4. **Test the deployment:**
```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/health

# API docs
open https://your-app.onrender.com/docs
```

## üí° Performance Tips

### Reduce Cold Start Time
Free tier apps sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity:
- First request may take 30-60 seconds
- Upgrade to paid tier for always-on service

### Optimize Memory Usage
```python
# Already optimized in app.py:
- reload=False  # Disabled auto-reload
- workers=1     # Single worker for free tier
- CPU-only mode # No GPU overhead
```

---

## üìû Still Having Issues?

1. **Check Render Status:** https://status.render.com
2. **Render Community:** https://community.render.com
3. **Review full logs** in Render dashboard
4. **Compare with working config** in `render.yaml`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Security Issue

**Your `.env` file contains an exposed API key!**

```properties
GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSyAxR3Q0aDKpQ66opBaaCmic6VpcCwKz8Hs"
```

**Action Required:**
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. **Regenerate your Gemini API key immediately**
3. Update the new key in Render dashboard only
4. Never commit API keys to git
5. The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` ‚úÖ
